## Live Demo
Check out the live version of the app here: [SynchroFest Live](https://synchro-fest.vercel.app/)

## Challenges & Solutions
### 1. Dynamic Seat Map Rendering
- **Challenge:** Rendering a seating chart with real-time updates.
- **Solution:** Implemented a dynamic layout system where users input the number of seats, rows, and layout direction (top, right, bottom, left). Considered stage positioning to ensure correct seat arrangement.

### 2. Live Updates Simulation
- **Challenge:** No real-time backend for live updates.
- **Solution:** Simulated real-time updates using a countdown timer and state management. A real-time system can later be implemented using Node.js or Firebase Firestore.

### 3. Design Inspiration
- The appâ€™s vibrant theme is inspired by futuristic music festivals, neon light aesthetics, and cosmic visuals. Colors like neon pink, electric blue, ultraviolet, and more enhance the immersive festival feel.

## Design Inspirations
- **Color Theme:** Neon lights, cosmic purples, and holographic effects inspired by futuristic, tech-themed festivals.
- **Typography:** Bold and modern fonts to represent the festival's energetic vibe.
- **UI Elements:** Smooth transitions and subtle animations for seat booking, countdown, and updates to reflect the excitement of live events.

## Conclusion
This project was an exciting challenge, focusing on real-time updates, immersive design, and a responsive UI. **SynchroFest** aims to bring fans closer to the action while ensuring smooth ticketing and seat selection.
